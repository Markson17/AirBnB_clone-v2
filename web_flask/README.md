# AirBnB Clone - Web Framework

This project focuses on building a web framework using Flask, a popular Python web framework. Through this project, you will learn how to define routes in Flask, handle variables in a route, use templates to create HTML responses in Flask, and how to display data from a MySQL database in HTML.

The project consists of several scripts that start a Flask web application, each with a specific functionality. These scripts include:

* `0-hello_route.py` - displays "Hello HBNB!" on the home page ("/")
* `1-hbnb_route.py` - displays "HBNB" on a specific route ("/hbnb")
* `2-c_route.py` - displays "C is fun!" on a specific route ("/c/<text>")
* `3-python_route.py` - displays "Python is cool!" on a specific route ("/python/<text>")
* `4-number_route.py` - displays a number only if it is an integer on a specific route ("/number/<n>")
* `5-number_template.py` - displays a HTML page only if n is an integer on a specific route ("/number_template/<n>")
* `6-number_odd_or_even.py` - displays whether a number is even or odd on a specific route ("/number_odd_or_even/<n>")
* `7-states_list.py` - displays a HTML page with a list of all the states on the home page ("/states_list")
* `8-cities_by_states.py` - displays a HTML page with a list of all the cities in a state on a specific route ("/cities_by_states")
* `9-states.py` - displays a HTML page with a list of all the states with a specific letter in their name on a specific route ("/states/<letter>")
* `10-hbnb_filters.py` - displays a HTML page with a list of all the places and the filter options on a specific route ("/hbnb_filters")
* `100-hbnb.py` - displays a HTML page with all the places, states and amenities on the home page ("/hbnb")

The project also includes an update to the engine file_storage.py to be used with Flask to display HBNB data.
